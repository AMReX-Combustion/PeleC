PelePhysics
===========
`PelePhysics` (`source <https://github.com/AMReX-Combustion/PelePhysics>`_ and `documentation <https://amrex-combustion.github.io/PelePhysics/>`_) is a repository of physics databases and implementation code for use with the `Pele` suite of of codes. There are several instances of shared physics between PeleC and PeleLM that are stored in PelePhysics. Specifically, equations of state and thermodynamic property evaluation, transport coefficients evaluation, and chemistry rate computation.
