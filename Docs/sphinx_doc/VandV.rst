Correctness - Verification and Validation
=========================================

PeleC undergoes significant testing to ensure correct operation. Synthetic tests are used to verify expected numerical performance (`Verification`_); correctness of the results is established through a collection of physically meaningful tests that are used as the basis for a regression test suite (`Validation`_). A suite of regression tests is run nightly and the results are posted `here <https://amrex-combustion.github.io/PeleCRegressionTestResults/>`_.
