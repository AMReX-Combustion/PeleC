Conservative system
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

PeleC advances the following set of fully compressible equations for the conserved state vector: :math:`\mathbf{U} = (\rho, \rho \mathbf{u}, \rho E, \rho Y_k, \rho A_k, \rho B_k):`

.. math::
 
  \begin{eqnarray}
  \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} &=& - \nabla \cdot (\rho \mathbf{u}) + S_{{\rm ext},\rho}, \\
  \frac{\partial (\rho \mathbf{u})}{\partial t} &=& - \nabla \cdot (\rho \mathbf{u} \mathbf{u}) - \nabla p +\rho \mathbf{g} + \mathbf{S}_{{\rm ext},\rho\mathbf{u}}, \\
  \frac{\partial (\rho E)}{\partial t} &=& - \nabla \cdot (\rho \mathbf{u} E + p \mathbf{u}) + \rho \mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{g} - \sum_k {\rho q_k \dot\omega_k} + \nabla\cdot k_{\rm th} \nabla T + S_{{\rm ext},\rho E}, \\
  \frac{\partial (\rho Y_k)}{\partial t} &=& - \nabla \cdot (\rho \mathbf{u} Y_k) + \rho \dot\omega_k + S_{{\rm ext},\rho Y_k}, \\
  \frac{\partial (\rho A_k)}{\partial t} &=& - \nabla \cdot (\rho \mathbf{u} A_k) + S_{{\rm ext},\rho A_k}, \\
  \frac{\partial (\rho B_k)}{\partial t} &=& - \nabla \cdot (\rho \mathbf{u} B_k) + S_{{\rm ext},\rho B_k}.
  \end{eqnarray}


Here :math:`\rho, \mathbf{u}, T, p`, and :math:`k_{\rm th}` are the density, velocity,
temperature, pressure, and thermal conductivity, respectively, and :math:`E
= e + \mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{u} / 2` is the total energy with :math:`e` representing the
internal energy.  In addition, :math:`Y_k` is the mass fraction of the :math:`k^{\rm th}` species,
with associated production rate, :math:`\dot\omega_k`, and
energy release, :math:`q_k`.  Here :math:`\mathbf{g}` is the gravitational vector, and
:math:`S_{{\rm ext},\rho}, \mathbf{S}_{{\rm ext},\rho\mathbf{u}}`, etc., are user-specified
source terms.  :math:`A_k` is an advected quantity, i.e., a tracer.  We also
carry around auxiliary variables, :math:`B_k`, which have a user-defined
evolution equation, but by default are treated as advected quantities.

In the code we also carry around :math:`T` and :math:`\rho e` in the conservative
state vector even though they are derived from the other conserved
quantities.  The ordering of the elements within :math:`\mathbf{U}` is defined
by integer variables in the routine ``set_method_params`` in ``Src_nd/PeleC_nd.F90``.

Some notes:

* Regardless of the dimensionality of the problem, we always carry
  all 3 components of the velocity. You should always initialize all velocity components to zero, and
  always construct the kinetic energy with all three velocity components.

* There are ``NADV`` advected quantities, which range from :math:`{\tt
  UFA: UFA+nadv-1}`.  The advected quantities have no effect at all on
  the rest of the solution but can be useful as tracer quantities.

* There are ``NSPEC`` species defined in the chemistry model, which range from :math:`{\tt UFS: UFS+nspec-1}`.

* There are ``NAUX`` auxiliary variables, from :math:`{\tt UFX:UFX+naux-1}`. The auxiliary variables are passed into the equation
  of state routines along with the species.



Primitive Forms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

PeleC uses the primitive form of the fluid equations, defined in terms of
the state :math:`\Qb = (\rho, \ub, p, \rho e, Y_k, A_k, B_k)`, to construct the
interface states that are input to the Riemann problem. All of the primitive variables are derived from the conservative state
vector. This task is performed in the routine ``ctoprim`` located in ``Src_nd/advection_util_nd.F90``.

The primitive variable equations for density, velocity, and pressure are:

.. math::
  \begin{eqnarray}
  \frac{\partial\rho}{\partial t} &=& -\mathbf{u}\cdot\nabla\rho - \rho\nabla\cdot\mathbf{u} + S_{{\rm ext},\rho} \\
  \frac{\partial\mathbf{u}}{\partial t} &=& -\mathbf{u}\cdot\nabla\mathbf{u} - \frac{1}{\rho}\nabla p + \mathbf{g} + 
  \frac{1}{\rho} (\mathbf{S}_{{\rm ext},\rho\mathbf{u}} - \mathbf{u} \; S_{{\rm ext},\rho}) \\
  \frac{\partial p}{\partial t} &=& -\mathbf{u}\cdot\nabla p - \rho c^2\nabla\cdot\mathbf{u} +
  \left(\frac{\partial p}{\partial \rho}\right)_{e,Y}S_{{\rm ext},\rho}\nonumber\\
  &&+\  \frac{1}{\rho}\sum_k\left(\frac{\partial p}{\partial Y_k}\right)_{\rho,e,Y_j,j\neq k}\left(\rho\dot\omega_k + S_{{\rm ext},\rho Y_k} - Y_kS_{{\rm ext},\rho}\right)\nonumber\\
  && +\  \frac{1}{\rho}\left(\frac{\partial p}{\partial e}\right)_{\rho,Y}\left[-eS_{{\rm ext},\rho} - \sum_k\rho q_k\dot\omega_k + \nabla\cdot k_{\rm th}\nabla T \right.\nonumber\\
  && \quad\qquad\qquad\qquad+\ S_{{\rm ext},\rho E} - \mathbf{u}\cdot\left(\mathbf{S}_{{\rm ext},\rho\mathbf{u}} - \frac{\mathbf{u}}{2}S_{{\rm ext},\rho}\right)\Biggr] 
  \end{eqnarray}

The advected quantities appear as:

.. math::
  \begin{eqnarray}
  \frac{\partial Y_k}{\partial t} &=& -\mathbf{u}\cdot\nabla Y_k + \dot\omega_k + \frac{1}{\rho}
                                     ( S_{{\rm ext},\rho Y_k}  - Y_k S_{{\rm ext},\rho} ), \\
  \frac{\partial A_k}{\partial t} &=& -\mathbf{u}\cdot\nabla A_k + \frac{1}{\rho}
                                     ( S_{{\rm ext},\rho A_k} - A_k S_{{\rm ext},\rho} ), \\
  \frac{\partial B_k}{\partial t} &=& -\mathbf{u}\cdot\nabla B_k + \frac{1}{\rho} 
                                     ( S_{{\rm ext},\rho B_k}  - B_k S_{{\rm ext},\rho} ).
  \end{eqnarray}


When accessing the primitive variable state vector, the integer variable
keys for the different quantities are listed in the routine ``set_method_params`` in ``Src_nd/PeleC_nd.F90``.

Note that the above system is augmented with an internal energy equation:

.. math::
  \begin{eqnarray}
  \frac{\partial(\rho e)}{\partial t} &=& - \mathbf{u}\cdot\nabla(\rho e) - (\rho e+p)\nabla\cdot\mathbf{u} - \sum_k \rho q_k\dot\omega_k 
                                        + \nabla\cdot k_{\rm th} \nabla T + S_{{\rm ext},\rho E} \nonumber\\
  && -\  \mathbf{u}\cdot\left(\mathbf{S}_{{\rm ext},\rho\mathbf{u}}-\frac{1}{2}S_{{\rm ext},\rho}\mathbf{u}\right), 
  \end{eqnarray}

This has two benefits. First, for a general equation of state,
carrying around an additional thermodynamic quantity allows us to
avoid equation of state calls (in particular, in the Riemann solver). Second, it is sometimes the case that the
internal energy calculated as :math:`e_T \equiv E - \frac{1}{2} \mathbf{v}^2` is
unreliable.  This has two usual causes: one, for high Mach number
flows, the kinetic energy can dominate the total gas energy, making
the subtraction numerically unreliable; two, if you use gravity or
other source terms, these can indirectly alter the value of the
internal energy if obtained from the total energy. 

Also, in the code we carry around :math:`T` in the primitive state vector.

Source Terms
~~~~~~~~~~~~

We now compute explicit source terms for each variable in :math:`\mathbf{Q}` and
:math:`\mathbf{U}`.  The primitive variable source terms will be used to construct
time-centered fluxes.  The conserved variable source will be used to
advance the solution. This task is performed in the routine ``srctoprim`` located in ``Src_nd/advection_util_nd.F90``. We neglect reaction source terms since they are
accounted for in the characteristic integration in the PPM algorithm.  The source terms are:

.. math::
  \begin{equation}
    \mathbf{S}_{\mathbf{Q}}^n =
    \left(\begin{array}{c}
    S_\rho \\
    S_{\mathbf{u}} \\
    S_p \\
    S_{\rho e} \\
    S_{Y_k} \\
    S_{A_k} \\
    S_{B_k}
    \end{array}\right)^n  =  \left(\begin{array}{c}  S_{{\rm ext},\rho} \\
    \mathbf{g} + \frac{1}{\rho}\mathbf{S}_{{\rm ext},\rho\mathbf{u}} \\
    \frac{1}{\rho}\frac{\partial p}{\partial e}S_{{\rm ext},\rho E} + \frac{\partial p}{\partial\rho}S_{{\rm ext}\rho} \\
    \nabla\cdot k_{\rm th} \nabla T + S_{{\rm ext},\rho E} \\
    \frac{1}{\rho}S_{{\rm ext},\rho Y_k} \\
    \frac{1}{\rho}S_{{\rm ext},\rho A_k} \\
    \frac{1}{\rho}S_{{\rm ext},\rho B_k}
    \end{array}\right)^n,
    \end{equation}

.. math::
    \begin{equation}
    \mathbf{S}_{\mathbf{U}}^n =
    \left(\begin{array}{c}
    \mathbf{S}_{\rho\mathbf{u}}\\
    S_{\rho E} \\
    S_{\rho Y_k} \\
    S_{\rho A_k} \\
    S_{\rho B_k}
    \end{array}\right)^n
    =
    \left(\begin{array}{c}
    \rho \mathbf{g} + \mathbf{S}_{{\rm ext},\rho\mathbf{u}} \\
    \rho \mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{g} + \nabla\cdot k_{\rm th} \nabla T + S_{{\rm ext},\rho E} \\
    S_{{\rm ext},\rho Y_k} \\
    S_{{\rm ext},\rho A_k} \\
    S_{{\rm ext},\rho B_k}
    \end{array}\right)^n.
    \end{equation}

PeleC Timestepping
------------------

PeleC supports two options for timestepping: a second-order explicit method-of-lines approach (MOL), and an iterative scheme base on a spectral deferred correction approach (SDC). Both time-steppers share a considerable amount of code.


Standard Time Advance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The MOL time stepper is a standard second order predictor-corrector approach with (optional) fixed point iteration to tightly couple the reaction and transport. The advection :math:`(A)` and diffusion :math:`(D)` terms are computed using a time-explicit finite-volume formulation; reaction terms are either computed explicitly or integrated (using DVODE or CVODE via SUNDIALS), with a forcing term that incorporates the (pointwise) influence of advection and diffusion (:math:`F_{AD}`).  The update is as follows:

.. math::
   S^n &= AD(u^n) \hspace{2em} {\small \text{(stencils require grow-cell data at }t^{n}\text{)}}

   u^* &= u^n + \Delta t(S^n +I_R)

   S^{n+1} &= AD(u^*) \hspace{2em} {\small \text{(stencils require grow-cell data at }t^{n+1}\text{)}}

   u^{**} &= \frac{1}{2}(u^n+u^*) + \frac{1}{2}\left(S^{n+1}+I_R\right){\Delta t}

   F_{AD} &= \frac{1}{\Delta t} (u^{**} -u^n) - I_R

   I_R &= I_R(u^n, F_{AD})

   u^{n+1} &= u^n + \Delta t(F_{AD} +I_R)\text{.}

On initialization, the reaction term :math:`(I_R)` is evaluated with :math:`(F_{AD} = 0)`; for subsequent time steps, the initial value of :math:`(I_R)` is taken from the previous time step.  The advection and diffusion terms (evaluated above at :math:`t^n` and :math:`t^{n+1}`) require grow cells to be filled at the appropriate solution time.  The filling operation is orchestrated by the AMReX software framework via the `FillPatch` operation.  Grow cells from neighboring mesh patches (and through periodic/re-entrant boundaries) are copied on intersection in index space.  User-specified functions provide data at the physical boundaries as a function of space and time.  Cells along the coarse-fine boundary are interpolated in space and time from available coarse data (note that this requires that the fine data be "properly nested" in the coarser levels).  Also, because :math:`(A)` and :math:`(D)` are both time-explicit, they are computed together using grow cells filled by the same `FillPatch` operation.

With time-implicit reactions, the final update is iterated:

.. math::
   S^{n+1,k} &= AD(u^{n+1,k})

   F_{AD}^{k} &= \frac{1}{2}(S^n+S^{n+1,k})

   I_R^{k} &= I_R(u^n, F_{AD}^{k})

   u^{n+1,k+1} &= u^n + \Delta t(F_{AD}^{k} +I_R^{k})\text{.}


Hyperbolics
-----------

Two hyperbolic treatments are available.

PPM
~~~

The unsplit piecewise parabolic method is used for regular geometries. The algorithm is presented here in 1D
for simplicity, but can be trivially extended to 2D and 3D. Note that the following description is taken from the paper
`Motheau and Wakefield, Capturing shocks and turbulence spectra in compressible flows. Part 2: A new hybrid PPM/WENO method  [Submitted 2019]`.

System of primitive variables
#############################


First, the system of primitive variables is recast in the following generic form:

.. math::
  \begin{equation}
    \frac{\partial \mathbf{Q}}{\partial t} + \mathbf{A} \frac{\partial \mathbf{Q}}{\partial x} = \mathbf{S}_{\mathbf{Q}}. \label{eqn:prim_var_eq}
  \end{equation}

Here :math:`\mathbf{Q}` is the primitive state vector, :math:`\mathbf{A}=\partial \mathbf{F}/\partial \mathbf{Q}` and :math:`\mathbf{S}_{\mathbf{Q}}`
are the viscous source terms reformulated in terms of the primitive variables.

In one dimension, this comes:

.. math::
  \begin{equation}
  \left(\begin{array}{c}
  \rho \\
  u \\
  p \\
  \rho e
  \end{array}\right)_t 
  +
  \left(\begin{array}{cccc}
  u & \rho &  0 & 0  \\
  0 & u &  \frac{1}{\rho} & 0  \\
  0 & \rho c^2 & u & 0 \\
  0 & \rho e + p & 0 & u 
  \end{array}\right)
  \left(\begin{array}{c}
  \rho \\
  u \\
  p \\
  \rho e 
  \end{array}\right)_x
  =
  \mathbf{S}_{\mathbf{Q}}
  \end{equation}

Note that here, the system of primitive variables has been extended to include an additional equation for the internal energy,
denoted :math:`e`. This avoids several calls to the equation of state, especially in the Riemann solver step. 

The eigenvalues of the matrix :math:`\mathbf{A}_x` are given by:

.. math::
  \begin{equation}
  \mathbf{\Lambda}\left(\mathbf{A}_x\right) = \{u-c,u,u,u+c\}.
  \end{equation}
  
The right column eigenvectors are:

.. math::
  \begin{equation}
  \mathbf{r}_x =
  \left(\begin{array}{ccccc}
  1 & 1 &  0  & 1 \\
  -\frac{c}{\rho} &  0 & 0 & \frac{c}{\rho} \\
  c^2 & 0  & 0 & c^2 \\
  h & 0 &  1  & h
  \end{array}\right).
  \end{equation}
  :label: matrix_lx
  
The left row eigenvectors, normalized so that :math:`\mathbf{l}_x\cdot\mathbf{r}_x = \mathbf{I}` are:

.. math::
  \begin{equation}
  \mathbf{l}_x =
  \left(\begin{array}{ccccc}
  0 & -\frac{\rho}{2c} &  \frac{1}{2c^2}  & 0 \\
  1 & 0  & -\frac{1}{c^2}  & 0 \\
  0 & 0 &  -\frac{h}{c^2}  & 0 \\
  0 & \frac{\rho}{2c} & \frac{1}{2c^2}  & 0
  \end{array}\right).
  \end{equation}
  :label: matrix_rx

Note that here, :math:`c` and :math:`h` are the sound speed and the enthalpy, respectively.

Edge state prediction
#####################

The fluxes are reconstructed from time-centered edge state values. Thus, the primitive variables are first interpolated in space with the PPM method,
then a characteristic tracing operation is performed to extrapolate in time their values at :math:`n+1/2`.


* Interpolation and slope limiting


Basically the goal of the algorithm is to compute a left and a right state of the primitive variables at each edge in order to provide inputs for the Riemann problem to solve. 

First, the average cross-cell difference is computed for each primitive variable with a quadratic interpolation as follows:

.. math::
  \begin{equation}
  \delta q_i = \frac{1}{2} \left(q_{i+1} - q_{i-1}\right).
  \end{equation} 

In order to enforce monotonicity, :math:`\delta q_i` is limited with the van Leer [1979] method:

.. math::
  \begin{equation}
  \delta q_i^* = \min \left(|\delta q_i|,2|q_{i+1}-q_i|,2|q_i - q_{i-1}|\right)\text{sgn}\left(\delta q_i\right),
  \end{equation}

and the interpolation of the primitive values to the cell face :math:`q_{i+\frac{1}{2}}` is estimated with:
 
.. math::
  \begin{equation}
  q_{i+\frac{1}{2}} = q_i + \frac{1}{2}\left(q_{i+1}-q_i \right)-\frac{1}{6}\left(\delta q_{i+1}^* - \delta q_i^* \right).
  \end{equation}

In order to enforce that :math:`q_{i+\frac{1}{2}}` lies between the adjacent cell averages, the following constraint is imposed:

.. math::
  \begin{equation}
  \min\left(q_i,q_{i+1} \right) \leqslant q_{i+\frac{1}{2}} \leqslant \max\left(q_i,q_{i+1} \right).
  \end{equation}

The next step is to set the values of :math:`q_{R,i-\frac{1}{2}}` and :math:`q_{L,i+\frac{1}{2}}`, which are the right and left state at the edges bounding a computational cell.
Here, a quartic limiter is employed in order to enforce that the interpolated parabolic profile is monotone.
The procedure proposed by Miller [2002] is adopted, which slightly differs from the original one proposed in Colella [1984]. In Miller [2002], this specific procedure is followed
by the imposition of another limiter based on a flattening parameter to prevent artificial extrema in the reconstructed values. Here in PeleC, the order of imposition
of the different limiting procedures is reversed.

First, the edge state values are defined as:

.. math::
  \begin{align}
  q_{L,i+\frac{1}{2}} = q_{i+\frac{1}{2}}, \\
  q_{R,i-\frac{1}{2}} = q_{i-\frac{1}{2}}.
  \end{align}

Then the flattening limiter is imposed as follows:

.. math::
  \begin{align}
  q_{L,i+\frac{1}{2}} \leftarrow \chi_i q_{L,i+\frac{1}{2}} + \left(1+\chi_i\right) q_i, \label{eqn:flattening_eq_1} \\
  q_{R,i-\frac{1}{2}} \leftarrow \chi_i q_{R,i-\frac{1}{2}} + \left(1+\chi_i\right) q_i, \label{eqn:flattening_eq_2}
  \end{align}

where :math:`\chi_i` is a flattening coefficient computed from the local pressure, and its evaluation is presented below.

Finally, the monotonization is performed with the following procedure:

.. math::
  \begin{align}
  q_{L,i+\frac{1}{2}} = q_{R,i-\frac{1}{2}} = q_i \hspace{0.8cm} &\text{if}  \hspace{0.2cm}   \left(q_{L,i+\frac{1}{2}} - q_i \right)\left(q_i - q_{R,i-\frac{1}{2}}\right) > 0, \\
  q_{L,i+\frac{1}{2}} = 3 q_i - 2 q_{R,i-\frac{1}{2}} \hspace{0.8cm} &\text{if}  \hspace{0.2cm} |q_{L,i+\frac{1}{2}}-q_i| \geqslant 2|q_{R,i-\frac{1}{2}}-q_i|, \\ 
  q_{R,i-\frac{1}{2}} = 3 q_i - 2 q_{L,i+\frac{1}{2}} \hspace{0.8cm} &\text{if}  \hspace{0.2cm} |q_{R,i-\frac{1}{2}}-q_i| \geqslant 2|q_{L,i+\frac{1}{2}}-q_i|.
  \end{align}



* Piecewise Parabolic Reconstruction


Once the limited values :math:`q_{R,i-\frac{1}{2}}` and :math:`q_{L,i+\frac{1}{2}}` are known, the limited piecewise parabolic reconstruction
in each cell is done by computing the average value swept out by parabola profile across a face, assuming that it moves at the speed of a
characteristic wave :math:`\lambda_k`. The average is defined by the following integrals:

.. math::
  \begin{align}
  \mathcal{I}^{(k)}_{+} \left(q_i \right) &= \frac{1}{\sigma_k \Delta x}\int^{(i+1/2)\Delta x}_{((i+1/2)-\sigma_k)\Delta x} q_i^I\left(x\right){\rm d}x, \\
  \mathcal{I}^{(k)}_{-} \left(q_i \right) &= \frac{1}{\sigma_k \Delta x}\int^{((i-1/2)+\sigma_k)\Delta x}_{(i-1/2)\Delta x} q_i^I\left(x\right){\rm d}x,
  \end{align}
  :label: int_parab_2

with :math:`\sigma_k = |\lambda_k|\Delta t / \Delta x`, where :math:`\lambda_k=\{u-c,u,u,u+c\}`, while :math:`\Delta t` and :math:`\Delta x` are the discretization
step in time and space, respectively, with the assumption that :math:`\Delta x` is constant in the computational domain.

The parabolic profile is defined by

.. math::
  \begin{equation}
  q_i^I \left(x\right) = q_{R,i-\frac{1}{2}} + \xi\left(x\right)\left[q_{L,i+\frac{1}{2}} - q_{R,i-\frac{1}{2}} + q_{i,6}\left(1-\xi\left(x\right)\right)\right]
  \end{equation}

with 

.. math:: q_{i,6} = 6 q_i - 3\left(q_{R,i-\frac{1}{2}} + q_{L,i+\frac{1}{2}} \right).   
   :label: parabolic_profile

and

.. math::
  \begin{equation}
  \xi \left(x\right) = \frac{x-x_{i-\frac{1}{2}}}{\Delta x}, \hspace{0.8cm} x_{i-\frac{1}{2}} \leqslant x \leqslant x_{i+\frac{1}{2}}
  \end{equation}r

Substituting :eq:`parabolic_profile` in :eq:`int_parab_2` leads to the following explicit formulations:

.. math::
  \begin{align}
  \mathcal{I}^{(k)}_{+} \left(q_i \right) &= q_{L,i+\frac{1}{2}} - \frac{\sigma_k}{2}\left[q_{L,i+\frac{1}{2}} - q_{L,i+\frac{1}{2}} - \left(1-\frac{2}{3}\sigma_k \right) q_{i,6} \right], \\
  \mathcal{I}^{(k)}_{-} \left(q_i \right) &= q_{R,i-\frac{1}{2}} + \frac{\sigma_k}{2}\left[q_{L,i+\frac{1}{2}} - q_{L,i+\frac{1}{2}} + \left(1-\frac{2}{3}\sigma_k \right) q_{i,6} \right].
  \end{align}

* Characteristic tracing and flux reconstruction

The next step is to extrapolate in time the integrals :math:`\mathcal{I}^{(k)}_{\pm}` to get the left and right edge states at time :math:`n+1/2`.
This procedure is complex, especially in multi-dimensions where transverse terms are taken into account; the complete detailed procedure can be found in Miller[2002].
In 1D, the left and right edge states are computed as follows:

.. math::
  \begin{align}
  q_{L,i+\frac{1}{2}}^{n+\frac{1}{2}} &= \mathcal{I}^{(k=u+c)}_{+} - \sum_{k:\lambda_k \geqslant 0} \beta_k \mathbf{l}_k \cdot \left[\mathcal{I}^{(k=u+c)}_{+}-\mathcal{I}^{(k)}_{+}  \right] \mathbf{r}_k + \frac{\Delta t}{2} S_i^n, \\
  q_{R,i-\frac{1}{2}}^{n+\frac{1}{2}} &= \mathcal{I}^{(k=u-c)}_{-} - \sum_{k:\lambda_k \leqslant 0} \beta_k \mathbf{l}_k \cdot \left[\mathcal{I}^{(k=u-c)}_{-}-\mathcal{I}^{(k)}_{-}  \right] \mathbf{r}_k + \frac{\Delta t}{2} S_i^n. \\
  \end{align}

where 

.. math::

  \begin{equation}
    \beta_k = \begin{cases}
        \frac{1}{2}, & \text{if}\;\lambda_k = 0,  \\
        1, & \text{otherwise},
    \end{cases}
  \end{equation}

and :math:`\mathbf{l}_k` and :math:`\mathbf{r}_k` are the left row and right column of the matrices defined at :eq:`matrix_lx` and :eq:`matrix_rx` for each eigenvalue :math:`k`.
Note that here, :math:`S_i^n` represents any source terms at time :math:`n` to include in the characteristic tracing operation.

 
Finally, the time-centered fluxes are computed using an approximate Riemann problem solver. At the end of this procedure the primitive variables are centered in time at :math:`n+1/2`,
and in space at the edges of a cell. This is the so-called `Godunov state` and the convective fluxes can be computed to create the advective source term.

    :p h: Grid spacing

Within this routine, for each direction, characteristic extrapolation is used to compute left and right states at the cell faces:

.. math::
  {u^l_\perp} = u^- + \frac{1}{2\rho^-}\left( \alpha^-_2 - \alpha^-_1\right)

  {p^l} = p^- + \frac{c}{2}\left( \alpha^-_2 +\alpha^-_1\right)

  u^l_{\parallel, 1} = v^- + \frac{1}{2} \alpha^-_3

  u^l_{\parallel, 2} = w^- + \frac{1}{2} \alpha^-_4

  \rho^l Y_k^l = Y_k^-\rho^- + \frac{1}{2c}\left[\alpha^-_{4+k} + Y_k^-\left(\alpha^-_1 + \alpha^-_2\right)\right]

  \rho^l = \sum{\rho^lY_k^l}

  Y_k^l = \frac{\rho^l Y_k^l}{\rho^l}

The right states are computed as:

.. math::
  {u^r_\perp} = u^+ - \frac{1}{2\rho^+}\left( \alpha^+_2 - \alpha^+_1\right)

  {p^r} = p^+ - \frac{c}{2}\left( \alpha^+_2 +\alpha^+_1\right)

  u^r_{\parallel, 1} = v^- - \frac{1}{2} \alpha^-_3

  u^r_{\parallel, 2} = w^- - \frac{1}{2} \alpha^-_4

  \rho^r Y_k^r = Y_k^+\rho^+ - \frac{1}{2c}\left[\alpha^+_{4+k} + Y_k^+\left(\alpha^+_1 + \alpha^+_2\right)\right]

  \rho^r = \sum{\rho^rY_k^r}

  Y_k^r = \frac{\rho^r Y_k^r}{\rho^r}

The computations in the y- and z- direction are analogous; the flux on an EB face to apply a no-slip boundary condition at a wall is somewhat different. In that case, the left and right states are taken as the state at the cell center, except for the velocity is reflected across the EB face. That is:

.. math:: 
  u^l_\perp = - u \cdot \vec{n}

  u^l_{\parallel, 1} = u^l_{\parallel_2} = 0.0

  p^l = p

  Y_k^l = Y_k

  \rho^l = \rho

and, as noted the right state is identical except for:

.. math::
  u^r_\perp = - u^l_\perp

Once the left and right states are computed, a Riemann solver (in this case one preserving the physical constraints on the intermediate state) is used to compute fluxes that are assembled into a conservative and non-conservative update for the regular and cut cells.

The characteristic extrapolation requires (slope limited) fluxes; these are found in the file slope_mol_3d_EB.f90. The call signature for the slope computation is:


.. f:function:: slope_module/slopex

    :p q: Input state
    :p flatn: Flattening coefficient (not used)
    :p qaux: Augmented state (used for sound speed)
    :p flag: Cell type flag

      
Which computes the slope routines compute (limited) slopes as:

.. math::
  \Delta_1^- = 0.5\frac{1}{c}\left(p-p^-\right) - 0.5 \rho \left( u - u^-\right)  

  \Delta_2^- = 0.5\frac{1}{c}\left(p-p^-\right) + 0.5 \rho \left( u - u^-\right)  

  \Delta_3^- = v - v^-

  \Delta_4^- = w - w^-

  \Delta^-_{k=5..nspec} = \rho Y_k - \rho^- Y_k^- - \frac{1}{c^2}Y_k \left(p-p^-\right)

If cell is irregular, or neighbor to left is irregular, :math:`\Delta^- = 0.0`.

.. math::
  \Delta_1^+ = 0.5\frac{1}{c}\left(p^+ - p\right) - 0.5\rho\left(u^+ - u\right)

  \Delta_2^+ = 0.5\frac{1}{c}\left(p^+ - p\right) + 0.5\rho\left(u^+ - u\right)

  \Delta_3^+ = v^+ - v

  \Delta_4^+ = w^+ - w

  \Delta_{5...nspc}^+ = \rho^+ Y_k^+ - \rho Y_k - \frac{Y_k}{c^2}\left(p^+ - p \right)

Again, if cell is irregular, or neighbor to right is irregular, :math:`\Delta^+ = 0.0`. Finally, the slopes are limited according to:

.. math::
  \Delta_i = \frac{1}{2}\left(\Delta_i^- + \Delta_i^+\right)


  \alpha_i^{\mathrm{lim}} = \mathrm{sign}\left\{\Delta_i \right\} \cdot \min\left\{ \Delta^{lim}_i, \left|\Delta_i \right|\right\}

where:

.. math::
  \Delta^{lim} = \left\{ \begin{aligned} {} 2 \min\left\{ |\Delta^-|,|\Delta^+|\right\} \quad& \mathrm{if} \Delta^- \cdot \Delta^+ \ge 0 \\ 0 & \quad \mathrm{otherwise}\end{aligned}\right.

The formulation of the y- and z-directions is analogous to the x-direction. 

Comparison of PPM and MOL for the decay of homogeneous isotropic turbulence
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Comparison of PPM and MOL were performed using the decay of
homogeneous isotropic turbulence. Initial conditions for the velocity
fields were provided by an incompressible spectral simulation. The
comparisons were performed at :math:`N=128^3` and :math:`512^3`. While
generally exhibiting similar results, the MOL is more dissipative that
the PPM, as shown in the figure below. For the MOL at :math:`N =
512^3`, the maximum relative error in kinetic energy is :math:`0.9\%`
and :math:`k_{90}= 3 k_{\lambda_0}` at :math:`t=5\tau`, for the PPM,
these numbers are :math:`0.5\%` and :math:`4 k_{\lambda_0}`. The
dissipation rate is under-predicted for the MOL. The energy spectra at
high wavenumbers for the MOL are lower than those for the
PPM. Finally, the MOL has a more restrictive CFL condition (CFL=0.3),
and, therefore, MOL simulations were approximately three times slower
than PPM simulations.

Diffusion
---------

Diffusion is modeled with a mixture average formulation.

Reaction
--------

A chemical reaction network is evaluated to determine the reaction source term.  The reaction network is selected at build time by setting the `CHEMISTRY_MODEL` flag in the makefile, where the value refers to one of the models available in `PelePhysics`. New models can be generated using `Fuego`, currently not part of `PelePhysics` but slated for inclusion in the near future.


Equation of State
-----------------

Several equation of state models are available based on ideal gas, gamma law gas or non-ideal equation of state.
