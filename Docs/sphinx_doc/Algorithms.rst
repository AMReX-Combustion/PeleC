Algorithms

PeleC Timestepping
------------------

PeleC uses two method of timestepping: a second order explicit method, and a spectral deferred correction (SDC) approach. These approaches share several code modules to perform the update; both used an iteration to couple the various physics together.


Standard Time Advance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The standard time advance is a second order predictor-corrector approach with (optional) fixed point iteration to tightly couple the reaction and transport. The Advection and diffusion (:math:`AD`) terms are computed explicitly using a finite-volume formulation; reaction terms are integrated with VODE (SUNDIALS) with a forcing term that includes advection and diffusion (:math:`F_{AD}`). For cold start the reaction term (:math:`I_R`) is evaluated from the instantaneous state without a forcing term.

.. math::
   S^n = AD(\overbrace{u^n}^\text{FillPatch at $t^n$})

   u^* = u^n + dt(S^n +I_R)

   S^{n+1}= AD(\overbrace{u^*}^\text{FillPatch at $t^{n+1}$})

   u^{**} = \frac{1}{2}(u^n+u^*) + \frac{1}{2}\left(S^{n+1}+I_R\right){dt}

   F_{AD} = \frac{1}{dt} (u^{**} -u^n) - I_R

   \text{update } I_R(u^n, F_{AD}) \text{ and }  u^{n+1} = u^n + dt(F_{AD} +I_R)\text{.}


Without reaction this would be the end of the timestep; with reaction, we iterate :math:`mol\_iters` times:

.. math::
   S^{n+1}= AD(\overbrace{u^{n+1}}^\text{FillPatch at $t^{n+1}$})

   F_{AD} = \frac{1}{2}(S^n+S^{n+1})

   \text{update } I_R(u^n, F_{AD}) \text{ and }  u^{n+1} = u^n + dt(F_{AD} +I_R)\text{.}


Hyperbolics
-----------

Two hyperbolic treatments are available.

PPM
~~~

The unsplit piecewise parabolic method is used for regular geometries and is the same algorithm used in several other AMReX codes including CASTRO and MAUI. 


Method of Lines with Characteristic Extrapolation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An alternative formulation well suited to Embedded Boundary geometry treatment and also available for regular grids is available and based on a method of lines approach.

Advective Flux Calculation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The advective (hyperbolic) fluxes computation is driven by the routine pc_hyp_mol_flux found in the file Hyp_pele_MOL_3d.F90, with call signature:

.. f:function:: hyp_advection_module/pc_hyp_mol_flux

    :p q: Input state
    :p qaux: Augmented state
    :p Ax: Apertures for X edges
    :p flux1: Flux in X direction on X edges
    :p Ay: Apertures for Y edges
    :p flux2: Flux in Y direction on Y edges
    :p Az: Apertures for Z edges
    :p flux3: Flux in Z direction on Z edges
    :p flatn: Flattening parameter (not used; passed to slope routines)
    :p V: Cell volumes
    :p D: Divergence (hyperbolic fluxes added to input divergence on output)
    :p flag: Cell type flag
    :p ebflux: Flux across EB face
    :p h: Grid spacing

Within this routine, for each direction, characteristic extrapolation is used to compute left and right states at the cell faces:

.. math::
  {u^l_\perp} = u^- + \frac{1}{2\rho^-}\left( \alpha^-_2 - \alpha^-_1\right)

  {p^l} = p^- + \frac{c}{2}\left( \alpha^-_2 +\alpha^-_1\right)

  u^l_{\parallel, 1} = v^- + \frac{1}{2} \alpha^-_3

  u^l_{\parallel, 2} = w^- + \frac{1}{2} \alpha^-_4

  \rho^l Y_k^l = Y_k^-\rho^- + \frac{1}{2c}\left[\alpha^-_{4+k} + Y_k^-\left(\alpha^-_1 + \alpha^-_2\right)\right]

  \rho^l = \sum{\rho^lY_k^l}

  Y_k^l = \frac{\rho^l Y_k^l}{\rho^l}

The right states are computed as:

.. math::
  {u^r_\perp} = u^+ - \frac{1}{2\rho^+}\left( \alpha^+_2 - \alpha^+_1\right)

  {p^r} = p^+ - \frac{c}{2}\left( \alpha^+_2 +\alpha^+_1\right)

  u^r_{\parallel, 1} = v^- - \frac{1}{2} \alpha^-_3

  u^r_{\parallel, 2} = w^- - \frac{1}{2} \alpha^-_4

  \rho^r Y_k^r = Y_k^+\rho^+ - \frac{1}{2c}\left[\alpha^+_{4+k} + Y_k^+\left(\alpha^+_1 + \alpha^+_2\right)\right]

  \rho^r = \sum{\rho^rY_k^r}

  Y_k^r = \frac{\rho^r Y_k^r}{\rho^r}

The computations in the y- and z- direction are analogous; the flux on an EB face to apply a no-slip boundary condition at a wall is somewhat different. In that case, the left and right states are taken as the state at the cell center, except for the velocity is reflected across the EB face. That is:

.. math:: 
  u^l_\perp = - u \cdot \vec{n}

  u^l_{\parallel, 1} = u^l_{\parallel_2} = 0.0

  p^l = p

  Y_k^l = Y_k

  \rho^l = \rho

and, as noted the right state is identical except for:

.. math::
  u^r_\perp = - u^l_\perp

Once the left and right states are computed, a Riemann solver (in this case one preserving the physical constraints on the intermediate state) is used to compute fluxes that are assembled into a conservative and non-conservative update for the regular and cut cells.

The characteristic extrapolation requires (slope limited) fluxes; these are found in the file slope_mol_3d_EB.f90. The call signature for the slope computation is:


.. f:function:: slope_module/slopex

    :p q: Input state
    :p flatn: Flattening coefficient (not used)
    :p qaux: Augmented state (used for sound speed)
    :p flag: Cell type flag

      
Which computes the slope routines compute (limited) slopes as:

.. math::
  \Delta_1^- = 0.5\frac{1}{c}\left(p-p^-\right) - 0.5 \rho \left( u - u^-\right)  

  \Delta_2^- = 0.5\frac{1}{c}\left(p-p^-\right) + 0.5 \rho \left( u - u^-\right)  

  \Delta_3^- = v - v^-

  \Delta_4^- = w - w^-

  \Delta^-_{k=5..nspec} = \rho Y_k - \rho^- Y_k^- - \frac{1}{c^2}Y_k \left(p-p^-\right)

If cell is irregular, or neighbor to left is irregular, :math:`\Delta^- = 0.0`.

.. math::
  \Delta_1^+ = 0.5\frac{1}{c}\left(p^+ - p\right) - 0.5\rho\left(u^+ - u\right)

  \Delta_2^+ = 0.5\frac{1}{c}\left(p^+ - p\right) + 0.5\rho\left(u^+ - u\right)

  \Delta_3^+ = v^+ - v

  \Delta_4^+ = w^+ - w

  \Delta_{5...nspc}^+ = \rho^+ Y_k^+ - \rho Y_k - \frac{Y_k}{c^2}\left(p^+ - p \right)

Again, if cell is irregular, or neighbor to right is irregular, :math:`\Delta^+ = 0.0`. Finally, the slopes are limited according to:

.. math::
  \Delta_i = \frac{1}{2}\left(\Delta_i^- + \Delta_i^+\right)


  \alpha_i^{\mathrm{lim}} = \mathrm{sign}\left\{\Delta_i \right\} \cdot \min\left\{ \Delta^{lim}_i, \left|\Delta_i \right|\right\}

where:

.. math::
  \Delta^{lim} = \left\{ \begin{aligned} {} 2 \min\left\{ |\Delta^-|,|\Delta^+|\right\} \quad& \mathrm{if} \Delta^- \cdot \Delta^+ \ge 0 \\ 0 & \quad \mathrm{otherwise}\end{aligned}\right.

The formulation of the y- and z-directions is analogous to the x-direction. 



Diffusion
---------

Diffusion is modeled with a mixture average formulation.

Reaction
--------

A chemical reaction network is evaluated to determine the reaction source term.  The reaction network is selected at build time by setting the `CHEMISTRY_MODEL` flag in the makefile, where the value refers to one of the models available in `PelePhysics`. New models can be generated using `Fuego`, currently not part of `PelePhysics` but slated for inclusion in the near future.


Equation of State
-----------------

Several equation of state models are available based on ideal gas, gamma law gas or non-ideal equation of state.
