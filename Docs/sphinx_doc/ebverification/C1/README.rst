C1. Method of manufactured solutions for EB
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Case description
################

This is a similar test case problem as performed for PeleC
verification using MASA to construct a manufactured solution. The MMS
is performed around a sphere at a Re number and Mach number of 1.

.. note::
   The first order convergence observed here is expected because the
   treatment of the EB surface is first order.
