Validation of PeleC
-------------------


The PeleC validation plan is aimed at exercising and validating the PeleC reacting flow capabilities. The following cases, described further on, are used for validation.

* Decay of homogeneous isotropic turbulence
* Non reacting Taylor-Green vortex breakdown
* Reacting Taylor-Green vortex breakdown
* Counter flow diffusion flame
* Counter flow premixed flame
* Flame-Vortex interaction
* Sandia Flame D
* Premixed ignition kernel in isotropic turbulence

.. warning::

   This section is a work in progress. Several of these cases have yet
   to be performed and are noted as such.


Decay of homogeneous isotropic turbulence
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _HIT:

Simulations were performed for turbulent Mach number = 0.1, Taylor
scale based Reynolds number = 100, Prandtl number = 0.71, and k0 = 4
at several different resolutions (uniform discretization, no AMR)
using a prescribed energy spectrum.

The definitions for the different quantities and reference data (in
black) can be found in `Johnsen et al. (2009) JCP
<http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcp.2009.10.028>`_ and `Movahed and
Johnsen (2015) JFM <http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/jfm.2015.200>`_. VisIt
was used to post-process some quantities using `visit_pp_aux_vars.py`
(located in the Exec/HIT folder) with the command

.. code-block:: bash

   $ visit -nowin -cli -s Exect/RegTests/visit_pp_aux_vars.py

Generating the initial conditions
#################################

The initial conditions for this validation problem are derived from
the following energy spectrum:

.. math::
   E(k) \sim k^4 \exp(-2 (k/k_0)^2), \frac{3 u'}{2} = \int_0^\infty E(k) \mathrm{d}k

and can be generated with the Python script in the HIT directory:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ python3 gen_hit_ic.py

Building and running
####################

The decay of homogeneous isotropic turbulence case can be found in ``Exec/RegTests/HIT``:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ make -j 16 DIM=3 USE_MPI=TRUE
   $ mpiexec -n 36 $EXECUTABLE inputs_3d

The user can run a convergence study by generating initial conditions
for higher resolutions and varying ``amr.ncell``.

As the resolution increases, there is good agreement between the Pele
data and reference data.

Reacting Taylor-Green vortex breakdown
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This test case is based on work by `Abdelsamie et al. (Mini-Symposium
on Verification and Validation of Combustion DNS, 17th Int. Conference
on Numerical Combustion, Aachen, Germany May 7, 2019` where a
Taylor-Green vortex setup used in non-reacting CFD is adapted to a
reacting flow configuration. Comparison of results from several
well-established codes such as Nek5000, DINO and YALES are provided in
the workshop documentation. We have performed the entire suite of
cases described in the workshop documentation and only present the
final 3D reacting case.

Good comparisons with the reference simulations were obtained in most
of the quantities of interest.

.. note::

   We are not using the constant Lewis approximation that is
   prescribed in the workshop documentation. Instead we rely on
   transport coefficients resulting from PelePhysics. This may lead to
   discrepancies with the reference results.

.. note::

   Because of computational constraints, we have not been able to
   perform higher resolution simulations that may show better
   convergence.




Counter flow diffusion flame
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This test case simulated the well-known counter flow diffusion flame
where fuel and oxidizer are injected head-on from opposite sides
forming a stagnation region. The fuel-oxidizer diffusion in the
stagnation region determines the flame location. The results from a
PeleC simulation are shown in the figure below. The fuel (CH4) is injected
from the left and air from the right.  The temperature distribution
indicates the flame location towards the oxidizer side. In a counter
flow diffusion flame the key quantity to vary is the strain rate which
is a function of mass flow rate of oxidizer and fuel streams. In this
validation exercise, a series of strain rates will be
simulated. Species and temperature profiles will be compared against
the benchmark experimental data and well-established chemical kinetics
solvers such as Cantera. The main motivation behind simulating a
number of strain rates is to check the capability of PeleC to
accurately reproduce the critical strain rate, known as the extinction
limit.

   :align: center
   :figwidth: 40%

   Fuel mass density is shown in left figure in g/cm3 (0(red)-1e-4(yellow)), oxygen mass density 
   is shown in the middle figure (0 (red)-1e-5 (yellow)) and temperature is shown in right figure (1800K (red) - 2300 (yellow)) along with 
   velocity vectors.

.. note::

   A quantitative comparison with Cantera for varying strain-rates is work in progress 

Counter flow premixed flame
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Similar to the counter-flow diffusion flame, a common test case
typically used to validate combustion codes is the opposed flow
premixed flame. In contrast to the diffusion flame, in this case the
opposing streams are composed of the same premixed
fuel-air mixture. This case is typically referred to as the twin
opposed flame because two flames are typically observed on the either
side of the stagnation point. This case is particularly attractive
since it allows for extinction at higher strain rates and simplified
boundary conditions, unburnt mixture and temperature. The metric of
comparison for the sake of validation would be species and temperature
profiles. Well known solution profiles from experiments and highly
resolved mesh converged 1-D Cantera simulations will be used to
establish the accuracy of PeleC. In addition to profiles, a comparison
of extinction strain rate will be also be made against the values
obtained from 1-D Cantera simulation. Finally, we will also validate
that PeleC simulations predict the correct premixed flame speed in the
low strain rate limit.

Flame-Vortex interaction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The flame-vortex interaction test case provides a fundamental
benchmark simulation to study interactions between the fluid flow and
a flame in a controlled environment. In this simulation setup, a 2D
flame front is initialized using profiles (velocity, species and
temperature) from a 1-D premixed flame. Additionally, velocity field
corresponding to a vortex field is superimposed using the Oseen vortex
expression. This simulation is performed in an unsteady fashion with
time evolution of flame area and stretch for varying ratios of vortex
strength and laminar flame speed as the key metric for
validation. Experimental data (`Thiesset et. al, Proc. Combust. Inst. Volume 36,
Issue 2, 2017, Pages 1843-1851`) and data from a number of previously
established simulation data will be used to validate PeleC.

Sandia Flame D
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Flame D from the Sandia series of piloted methane/air turbulent jet
flames (`R. S. Barlow and J. H. Frank, Proc. Combust. Inst. Volume 27, 1998, Pages
1087-1095`) is a canonical case for assessment of nonpremixed
combustion models for LES in the literature and at the International
Workshop on Measurement and Computation of Turbulent Flames
(TNF). Extensive measurements of product species and temperature were
taken at several locations in the flame, providing a wealth of data
against which simulations can be validated. For validation of LES
models for nonpremixed combustion in PeleC, conditional means and
variances of temperature and species at several axial locations will
be compared.

Premixed ignition kernel in isotropic turbulence
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This test case is based on a set of DNS of spherical premixed Jet-A
fuel/air kernels in decaying isotropic turbulence performed at Sandia
National Laboratories (`A. Krisman, T. Lu, and J. H. Chen, National
Combustion Meeting, 2017, Paper #2E04`). This test case will be used for
validation of LES premixed combustion models in PeleC. This case
allows for a priori model evaluation of local predictions of filtered
reaction rates as well as a posteriori comparisons of global
quantities of interest (kernel radius over time, successful or failed
ignition).
