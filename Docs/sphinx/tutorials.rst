The several cases in the *ExecCpp/Tutorials* directory are a good starting point for setting up a new PeleC case. In addition, there are several `tutorials from AMReX <https://amrex-codes.github.io/amrex/docs_html/Basics.html#example-heatequation-ex1-c>`_ that may be useful for general familiarity with how to build and run AMReX codes.

EB_Sphere
~~~~~~~~~
Reacting flow around a sphere

EB_ObliqShock
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Supersonic flow over a wedge resulting in a steady attached oblique shock

EB_BluffBody
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Non-reacting flow around a diamond-shaped body

EB_Channel
~~~~~~~~~~
Laminar non-reacting flow in a pressure-driven channel (oriented at an angle with respect to the grid)

EB_stube
~~~~~~~~~~
Shock tube problem in a rotating tube (using similar infrastructure as EB_Channel)
