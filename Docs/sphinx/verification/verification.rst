Verification of PeleC
---------------------

Verification of PeleC uses `MASA
<https://github.com/manufactured-solutions/MASA>`_ and
auto-differention tools to implement the Method of Manufactured
Solutions into PeleC.

The :math:`L_2` error norm for a quantity :math:`s` is defined as

.. math::
   e_s = \sqrt{ \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N_e} \int_{V_i} (s^h-s^*)^2 \mathrm{d}V}{\sum_{i=1}^{N_e} \|V_i\|}}

where :math:`s^h` is the numerical solution, :math:`s^*` is the exact
solution, and :math:`N_e` is the number of elements. :math:`N`, used
below, is the number of element on a side of the cube (:math:`N_e =
N^3`).

Building and running MMS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The user must first build and install `MASA
<https://github.com/manufactured-solutions/MASA>`_. This can be done
from source or using `Spack <https://spack.io>`_.

Building MASA from source
#########################

The user must build both `Metaphysicl
<https://github.com/roystgnr/MetaPhysicL>`_ and MASA. After defining
``METAPHYSICL_ROOT_DIR`` and ``MASA_ROOT_DIR``:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ git clone https://github.com/roystgnr/MetaPhysicL
   $ ./bootstrap
   $ ./configure --prefix=$METAPHYSICL_ROOT_DIR
   $ make
   $ make install

.. code-block:: bash

   $ git clone https://github.com/manufactured-solutions/MASA
   $ ./bootstrap
   $ ./configure --enable-fortran-interfaces METAPHYSICL_DIR=$METAPHYSICL_ROOT_DIR --prefix=$MASA_ROOT_DIR --enable-python-interfaces
   $ make
   $ make check
   $ make install



Building MASA using Spack
#########################

Assuming the user has Spack configured for their system, building and
installing MASA is as easy as:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ spack install masa


Linking MASA to PeleC and running
#################################

For the MMS problem setup, one must specify the install location for
MASA in the ``MASA_HOME`` variable. This can be done on the command
line either as:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ export MASA_HOME=$MASA_ROOT_DIR

or, when compiling PeleC,

.. code-block:: bash

   $ make -j 16 DIM=3 USE_MPI=TRUE MASA_HOME=$MASA_ROOT_DIR

where ``MASA_ROOT_DIR`` is the MASA install location. If using Spack
and after loading the MASA module, the ``MASA_ROOT_DIR`` will be
automatically populated.

After building the PeleC MMS executable, one can perform an MMS
convergence study to demonstrate formal accuracy of the numerical
implementation. Results of several MMS tests are detailed below.

Running the full MMS suite
##########################

The full MMS suite can be executed through the `PeleCRegressionTesting
<https://github.com/AMReX-Combustion/PeleRegressionTesting>`_ test
suite:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ ./verify-pelec.sh



Testing the Euler equations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We can turn off diffusion in Pele and set the coefficients for those
terms to zero in MASA to test the hydrodynamic update. A convergence
study shows second order for Pele's treatment of the hydrodynamic
source. The initial solution was initialized to the exact solution and
100 pseudo-time steps were taken (fixed to :math:`10^{-8}`). Periodic boundaries
are imposed everywhere.

Testing the compressible Navier-Stokes equations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For these cases, the Reynolds, Mach, and Prandtl numbers were set to 1
to ensure that the different physics were equally important
(viscosity, conductivity, and bulk viscosity are non-zero and
determined by the appropriate non-dimensional number). The CFL
condition was fixed to 0.1 to ensure that the predictor-corrector time
stepping method found a solution to the system of equations. The
initial solution was initialized to the exact solution. Periodic
boundaries are imposed everywhere. A convergence study shows second
order for Pele's treatment of the compressible Navier-Stokes
equations.

Initial difficulties in getting the solution to reach steady state for
the Euler equations (no diffusion) were overcome by incorporating
diffusion effects and reducing the CFL number. Setting the Reynolds,
Mach, and Prandtl to 1, and taking small time steps ensures that the
pseudo-time integration (predictor/corrector) does not oscillate
wildly and fail to find the steady-state solution. The iterative error
was monitored and the final time (identical for all simulations) was
chosen so that the iterative error was small,
:math:`\mathcal{O}(10^{6})` smaller than the discretization error. The
iterative error never reaches machine zero. This is most likely due to
the way in which the predictor/correct pseudo-time integration uses
time steps based on the wave speeds and viscosity and not adjusting
the time step based on the Jacobian of the system. An actual
steady-state solver (rather than a pseudo-time integration to steady
state) would be more efficient and more robust at finding the steady
state solution of the MMS system of equations. While this would test
the spatial discretization scheme, an MMS simulation with a steady
state solver would fail to test the temporal discretization scheme.

Testing the adaptive mesh refinement algorithm
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This setup is similar to the previous one except for the fact that
this test uses the AMR framework. There are two grid refinement
levels: a coarse grid covering the entire domain and a fine grid on
top of this one covering 50% of the domain. The grids are fixed in
time, i.e. they do not adapt based on the solution value. This test
ensures that the algorithms dealing with the grid interfaces, time
integration of the different levels, and level synchronization
preserve the second order accuracy of the code.

Testing the constant Smagorinsky Large Eddy Simulation model
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This setup is identical to the MMS study for the compressible
Navier-Stokes equations. The Large Eddy Simulation (LES) constants,
:math:`C_s` and :math:`C_I`, were chosen such that the turbulent eddy
viscosity was comparable to the viscosity,
i.e. :math:`\frac{\mu_t}{\mu} = \mathcal{O}(1)`. Since the model
scales with the mesh spacing, :math:`C_s` and :math:`C_I` were scaled
inversely with the mesh spacing for the mesh refinement studies. For
example, :math:`C_s` is set to 2 for the :math:`8^3` mesh and set to 4
for the :math:`16^3` mesh (for :math:`C_I`, it is 1 and 4,
respectively). A convergence study shows second order for Pele's
treatment of the compressible Navier-Stokes equations with the
constant Smagorinsky Large Eddy Simulation model.
