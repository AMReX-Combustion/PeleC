Conservative system
-------------------

PeleC advances the following set of fully compressible equations for the conserved state vector: :math:`\mathbf{U} = (\rho, \rho \mathbf{u}, \rho E, \rho Y_k, \rho A_k, \rho B_k):`

.. math::
 
  \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} &=& - \nabla \cdot (\rho \mathbf{u}) + S_{{\rm ext},\rho},

  \frac{\partial (\rho \mathbf{u})}{\partial t} &=& - \nabla \cdot (\rho \mathbf{u} \otimes \mathbf{u} + \mathbf{\Pi}) - \nabla p +\rho \mathbf{g} + \mathbf{S}_{{\rm ext},\rho\mathbf{u}},

  \frac{\partial (\rho E)}{\partial t} &=& - \nabla \cdot (\rho \mathbf{u} E + p \mathbf{u}) - \nabla \cdot (\mathbf{\Pi} \cdot \mathbf{u}) + \rho \mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{g} + \nabla\cdot \boldsymbol{\mathcal{Q}}+ S_{{\rm ext},\rho E},

  \frac{\partial (\rho Y_k)}{\partial t} &=& - \nabla \cdot (\rho \mathbf{u} Y_k)
  - \nabla \cdot \boldsymbol{\mathcal{F}}_{k} + \rho \dot\omega_k + S_{{\rm ext},\rho Y_k},

  \frac{\partial (\rho A_k)}{\partial t} &=& - \nabla \cdot (\rho \mathbf{u} A_k) + S_{{\rm ext},\rho A_k},

  \frac{\partial (\rho B_k)}{\partial t} &=& - \nabla \cdot (\rho \mathbf{u} B_k) + S_{{\rm ext},\rho B_k}.


Here :math:`\rho, \mathbf{u}, T`, and :math:`p` are the density, velocity,
temperature and pressure, respectively. :math:`E
= e + \mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{u} / 2` is the total energy with :math:`e` representing the internal energy, which is defined as in the CHEMKIN standard to include both sensible
and chemical energy (species heats of formation) and is conserved across chemical reactions. 
:math:`Y_k` is the mass fraction of the :math:`k^{\rm th}` species,
with associated production rate, :math:`\dot\omega_k`.  Here :math:`\mathbf{g}` is the gravitational vector, and
:math:`S_{{\rm ext},\rho}, \mathbf{S}_{{\rm ext},\rho\mathbf{u}}`, etc., are user-specified
source terms.  :math:`A_k` is an advected quantity, i.e., a tracer.  Also
:math:`\boldsymbol{\mathcal{F}}_{m}, \mathbf{\Pi}`, and :math:`\boldsymbol{\mathcal{Q}}` are
the diffusive transport fluxes for species, momentum and heat.  Note that the internal
energy for species :math:`k` includes its heat of formation (and can therefore take on negative and
positive values). The auxiliary fields, :math:`B_k`, have a user-defined
evolution equation, but by default are treated as advected quantities.

In the code we carry around :math:`T` and :math:`\rho e` in the
state vector even though they are redundant with the state since they may be derived from the other conserved
quantities.  The ordering of the elements within :math:`\mathbf{U}` is defined
by integer variables in the header file ``Source/IndexDefines.H``.

Some notes:

* Regardless of the dimensionality of the problem, we always carry
  all 3 components of the velocity. You should always initialize all velocity components to zero, and
  always construct the kinetic energy with all three velocity components.

* There are ``NUM_ADV`` advected quantities, whose indices in the state vector range from :math:`{\tt
  UFA: UFA+nadv-1}`.  Here, ``UFA(=7)`` refers to the number of conserverd variables not including the transported species. The advected quantities have no effect at all on
  the rest of the solution but can be useful as tracer quantities.

* There are ``NUM_SPECIES`` species defined in the chemistry model, whose indices in the state vector range from :math:`{\tt UFS: UFS+nspecies-1}` where ``UFS=UFA+nadv``.

* There are ``NUM_AUX`` auxiliary variables, from :math:`{\tt UFX:UFX+naux-1}`. Here, ``UFX=UFS+NUM_SPECIES``. The auxiliary variables are passed into the equation of state routines along with the species.

* There are ``NUM_LIN`` linear passive variables, from :math:`{\tt ULIN:ULIN+NUM\_LIN-1}`. The linear passive variables are scalar variables where :math:`\mathbf{U}=\mathbf{Q}` instead of :math:`\mathbf{U}=\rho\mathbf{Q}`



Primitive Forms
---------------

PeleC uses the primitive form of the inviscid fluid equations, defined in terms of
the state :math:`\mathbf{Q} = (\rho, \mathbf{u}, p, \rho e, Y_k, A_k, B_k)`, to construct the
interface states that are input to the Riemann problem. All of the primitive variables are derived from the conservative state
vector. This task is performed in the function ``pc_ctoprim`` located in ``Source/Utilities.H``.

The inviscid equations for primitive variables namely density, velocity, and pressure are:

.. math::
  
  \frac{\partial\rho}{\partial t} &=& -\mathbf{u}\cdot\nabla\rho - \rho\nabla\cdot\mathbf{u} + S_{{\rm ext},\rho}

  \frac{\partial\mathbf{u}}{\partial t} &=& -\mathbf{u}\cdot\nabla\mathbf{u} - \frac{1}{\rho}\nabla p + \mathbf{g} + 
  \frac{1}{\rho} (\mathbf{S}_{{\rm ext},\rho\mathbf{u}} - \mathbf{u} \; S_{{\rm ext},\rho})

  \frac{\partial p}{\partial t} &=& -\mathbf{u}\cdot\nabla p - \rho c^2\nabla\cdot\mathbf{u} +
  \left(\frac{\partial p}{\partial \rho}\right)_{e,Y}S_{{\rm ext},\rho}\nonumber

  &&+\  \frac{1}{\rho}\sum_k\left(\frac{\partial p}{\partial Y_k}\right)_{\rho,e,Y_j,j\neq k}\left(\rho\dot\omega_k + S_{{\rm ext},\rho Y_k} - Y_kS_{{\rm ext},\rho}\right)\nonumber

  && +\  \frac{1}{\rho}\left(\frac{\partial p}{\partial e}\right)_{\rho,Y}\left[-eS_{{\rm ext},\rho} - \sum_k\rho q_k\dot\omega_k + \nabla\cdot k_{\rm th}\nabla T \right.\nonumber

  && \quad\qquad\qquad\qquad+\ S_{{\rm ext},\rho E} - \mathbf{u}\cdot\left(\mathbf{S}_{{\rm ext},\rho\mathbf{u}} - \frac{\mathbf{u}}{2}S_{{\rm ext},\rho}\right)\Biggr] 
  

The advected quantities appear as:

.. math::
  
  \frac{\partial Y_k}{\partial t} &=& -\mathbf{u}\cdot\nabla Y_k + \dot\omega_k + \frac{1}{\rho}
                                     ( S_{{\rm ext},\rho Y_k}  - Y_k S_{{\rm ext},\rho} ),

  \frac{\partial A_k}{\partial t} &=& -\mathbf{u}\cdot\nabla A_k + \frac{1}{\rho}
                                     ( S_{{\rm ext},\rho A_k} - A_k S_{{\rm ext},\rho} ),

  \frac{\partial B_k}{\partial t} &=& -\mathbf{u}\cdot\nabla B_k + \frac{1}{\rho} 
                                     ( S_{{\rm ext},\rho B_k}  - B_k S_{{\rm ext},\rho} ).
  


When accessing the primitive variable state vector, the integer variable
keys for the different quantities are listed in the header file ``Source/IndexDefines.H``.


Source Terms
------------

We now compute explicit source terms for each variable in :math:`\mathbf{Q}` and
:math:`\mathbf{U}`.  The primitive variable source terms will be used to construct
time-centered fluxes.  The conserved variable source will be used to
advance the solution. This task is performed in the function ``pc_srctoprim`` located in ``Source/Hydro.H``. We neglect reaction source terms since they are
accounted for in the characteristic integration in the PPM algorithm.  The source terms are:

.. math::
  
    \mathbf{S}_{\mathbf{Q}}^n =
    \left(\begin{array}{c}
    S_\rho \\
    S_{\mathbf{u}} \\
    S_p \\
    S_{\rho e} \\
    S_{Y_k} \\
    S_{A_k} \\
    S_{B_k}
    \end{array}\right)^n  =  \left(\begin{array}{c}  S_{{\rm ext},\rho} \\
    \mathbf{g} + \frac{1}{\rho}\mathbf{S}_{{\rm ext},\rho\mathbf{u}} \\
    \frac{1}{\rho}\frac{\partial p}{\partial e}S_{{\rm ext},\rho E} + \frac{\partial p}{\partial\rho}S_{{\rm ext}\rho} \\
    \nabla\cdot k_{\rm th} \nabla T + S_{{\rm ext},\rho E} \\
    \frac{1}{\rho}S_{{\rm ext},\rho Y_k} \\
    \frac{1}{\rho}S_{{\rm ext},\rho A_k} \\
    \frac{1}{\rho}S_{{\rm ext},\rho B_k}
    \end{array}\right)^n,
    

.. math::
    
    \mathbf{S}_{\mathbf{U}}^n =
    \left(\begin{array}{c}
    \mathbf{S}_{\rho}\\
    \mathbf{S}_{\rho\mathbf{u}}\\
    S_{\rho E} \\
    S_{\rho Y_k} \\
    S_{\rho A_k} \\
    S_{\rho B_k}
    \end{array}\right)^n
    =
    \left(\begin{array}{c}
    \mathbf{S}_{{\rm ext},\rho} \\
    \rho \mathbf{g} + \mathbf{S}_{{\rm ext},\rho\mathbf{u}} \\
    \rho \mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{g} + \nabla\cdot k_{\rm th} \nabla T + S_{{\rm ext},\rho E} \\
    S_{{\rm ext},\rho Y_k} \\
    S_{{\rm ext},\rho A_k} \\
    S_{{\rm ext},\rho B_k}
    \end{array}\right)^n.
