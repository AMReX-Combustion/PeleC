| Problem definition |  | Test the species boundary condition on the EB surface
| EB geometry        |  | 3 different planes aligned with each coordinate direction
| Mechanism          |  | Li-Dryer H2-Air 9 species 
| Multi-level        |  | No
| Metric             |  | Initialize a linear profile for species, eventually gradient perpendicular to EB surface should approach 0
