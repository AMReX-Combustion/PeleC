| Problem definition | Test the species boundary condition on the EB surface                                                      |
| EB geometry        | 3 different planes aligned with each coordinate direction                                                  |
| Mechanism          | Li-Dryer H2-Air 9 species                                                                                  |
| Multi-level        | No                                                                                                         |
| Metric             | Initialize a linear profile for species, eventually gradient perpendicular to EB surface should equal 0    |
