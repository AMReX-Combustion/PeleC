## Notes

Identical problem setup can be used to validate thermal diffusion and
viscous diffusion (impulsively started plate). Boundary conditions would
be more of an issue for the viscous diffusion problem.

Due to bounary effects, only validate profiles in the normal direction
near the center of the planar surface where boundary effect will be smallest
for either case.

BC on planar surface : 301 K stationary or 300K w/in-plane velocity
BC on domain bundaries : insulated walls or outflow
IC in domain : 300 K, quiescent
