# Decay of Homogeneous Isotropic Turbulence

This setup is one of the test problems outlined in
[Johnsen et al. (2010) J. Comp Phys.](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcp.2009.10.028) It
has been detailed in many other papers, including (but not limited to)
[Youngs (1984) Phys. D: Nonlinear Phen.](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0167-2789(84)90512-8),
[Thornber and Drikakis (2006) ECOMAS](http://repository.tudelft.nl/assets/uuid:ed4bd9db-f347-4173-8ccb-65634ac5fd25/Thornber.pdf),
and
[Lee et al. (1991) Phys. Fluids](http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.858071).


## Generating the initial condition

The initial condition is generated by `gen_hit_ic.py` and stored in
files with the prefix `hit_ic_k0_N.dat`, where `k0` is the most
energetic wave number and `N` is the size of the grid. The initial
condition for a grid of size N^3 is generated as follows:

1. velocity fluctuations generated on a 512^3 grid in wavenumber space
2. Coefficients associated to wavenumbers that cannot be represented on the desired grid are set to 0 (sharp wavenumber cutoff)
3. inverse Fourier transform of the velocity fluctuations (512^3 grid)
4. velocity fluctuations resampled on the desired grid (N^3)

This script accepts the following options
```
./gen_hit_ic.py --help
usage: gen_hit_ic.py [-h] [-k0 K0] [-N N] [-s SEED] [-p]

Generate the velocity fluctuations for the HIT IC

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -k0 K0                Wave number containing highest energy
  -N N                  Resolution
  -s SEED, --seed SEED  Random number generator seed
  -p, --plot            Save a plot of the x-velocit1y
```

Generating an initial condition file is as easy as: 
```{bash}
./gen_hit_ic.py -N 16
```

## Running the code

PeleC reads the file generated by the above script. The IC file name
resolution is specified by the user. The IC data is interpolated to
the Pele grid nodes and the user can (optionally) normalize the input
data using the `uin_norm` parameter.
