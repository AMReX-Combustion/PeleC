# Advected and auxiliary quantities

This demonstrates the use of the advected and auxiliary quantities described in the PeleC model [equations](https://amrex-combustion.github.io/PeleC/Equations.html). The case introduces two advected and two auxiliary quantities into the domain.  The auxiliary quantities experience exponential decay with a source term of $S_{ext,\rho B_k} = -8500 \rho B_k$.
