# Advected and auxiliary quantities

This demonstrates the use of the advected and auxiliary quantities described in the PeleC model [equations](https://amrex-combustion.github.io/PeleC/Equations.html). The case introduces two advected and two auxiliary quantities into the domain.  The auxiliary quantities experience simple exponential decay with a source term of $S_{ext,B_k} = -30 B_k$.
