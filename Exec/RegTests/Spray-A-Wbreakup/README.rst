Spray A Problem
---------------

This is a Spray A test problem based on a configuration from ECN. This problem uses the KHRT breakup model and provides good comparisons with the experimental liquid and vapor penetrations.

In order to run this problem, create a new directory called `PelePhysics/Support/Mechanism/multi_dechep` and move the mechanism files in the local `chem_files` directory into it.
