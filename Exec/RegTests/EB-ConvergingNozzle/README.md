# Subsonic flow in a converging nozzle geometry

This simulation is of a subsonic flow in a converging nozzle
geometry. The initial condition is a quiescent flow field. The inflow
velocity is specified on the low x-direction boundary. Outflow is
specified at the high x-direction boundary using first order
extrapolation.
